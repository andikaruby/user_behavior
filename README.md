Here’s what that means in detail:
1. Introduce the Project (Context & Purpose)

    Explain what the project is, why it exists, and what problem it solves.

    Helps newcomers quickly understand the relevance and goals of the project.

2. Provide Setup and Usage Instructions

    Step-by-step installation, configuration, and running instructions.

    Ensures anyone can replicate or deploy the project without digging into the code.

3. Explain How to Contribute or Extend

    Guidelines for contributing code, reporting issues, or suggesting features.

    Promotes collaboration and maintainability, especially in open-source projects.

4. Document Project Structure and Key Features

    Overview of the directory structure, core files, and major features.

    Reduces onboarding time for new developers.

5. Clarify Requirements and Dependencies

    List supported platforms, dependencies, and compatibility considerations.

    Prevents errors due to missing libraries or unsupported environments.

6. Provide Quick References (Links, License, Credits)

    Link to documentation, demos, issue trackers, CI/CD badges, or APIs.

    Acknowledge contributors and specify license terms.

7. Set the Tone & First Impression

    The README often acts as the face of your project (especially on GitHub).

    A polished README signals quality, professionalism, and active maintenance.

In short:

    A README’s ultimate function is to orient, enable, and inspire confidence in anyone approaching the project — turning confusion into clarity, and interest into engagement.
